Real-Time Recommendation System for E-commerce
Welcome to the Real-Time Recommendation System project! This system demonstrates how e-commerce platforms can provide personalized product recommendations to users based on their browsing or purchase history. The project implements two recommendation approaches: content-based filtering and collaborative filtering.

Features
Content-Based Filtering: Suggests products similar to those the user has interacted with, based on product features like category or description.
Collaborative Filtering: Recommends products by analyzing user behavior and identifying patterns among similar users.
Scalable Design: The project can be extended to larger datasets and more complex algorithms for real-world applications.
How It Works
Content-Based Filtering
Uses TF-IDF vectorization to analyze product features (like categories).
Measures product similarity with cosine similarity.
Example: If a user interacts with a "Laptop," the system recommends similar items like "Smartphone" or "Charger."
Collaborative Filtering
Analyzes user purchase history to find shared interests among users.
Calculates similarity using a simple Jaccard Similarity algorithm.
Example: If User 1 purchased a "Laptop" and a "Charger," the system might recommend "Mouse" based on overlapping preferences.
Dataset
The project uses a small, simulated dataset for demonstration purposes:

Products Dataset:

Includes product ID, name, and category.
Example: Laptop, Smartphone, Charger, etc.
User Purchase History:

Simulates past purchases of users.
Example: User 1 purchased "Laptop" and "Charger."
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-recommendation-system.git
cd real-time-recommendation-system
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas scikit-learn
Run the project:

bash
Copy
Edit
python recommendation_system.py
Output Example
Content-Based Recommendation:
Input: "Laptop"
Output: "Smartphone, Charger, Headphones"
Collaborative Filtering Recommendation:
Input: UserID = 1
Output: "Charger, Mouse, Laptop"
How to Use
Content-Based Recommendation: Modify the content_based_recommendation function to input the product you want recommendations for.

Collaborative Filtering: Modify the collaborative_filtering function to input the UserID you want recommendations for.

Future Improvements
Add a larger and real-world dataset.
Integrate a user interface for easier interaction.
Implement advanced collaborative filtering using matrix factorization or deep learning techniques.
Deploy the system as a web application.
